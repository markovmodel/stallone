/**
 * A simple framework for data processing in pipelines or networks.
 * Each data processing step or stage is a DataProcessor. DataProcessors can
 * read, transform, use or write data. DataProcessors can be connected so as to
 * define the data processing logic and dependencies. From this, the sequence 
 * in which computations are made is defined.
